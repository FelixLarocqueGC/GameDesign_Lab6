Josh: What am I going to do?
-> What's wrong?
    Josh: It looks like the house took some damage from the earthquake.
    Josh: Luckily, i don't think any structural damage was done to the building.
    -> Do you know anything about this photo?
        Josh: Let me take a look...
        Josh: No, I don't recognize them, but maybe Cole may know something about it?
        Josh: Nevermind that though, the house is in serious condition it seems.
        -> Is there anything i can do to help?
            Josh: Really!? You'll help me out?
            Josh: Let me think...
            Josh: First we need to repair the roof.
            Josh: Would you be able to collect 10 wood and 10 stone?
            -> Of Course!
